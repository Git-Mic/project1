The idea behind this app is that whenever you go out to a venue, concert ,etc it is usually pretty expensive to dine there.In order to help the user decide what they want to eat we provide a service that when you pick a location you are given retaurants within driving distance of your venue.

The CSS framework that will be used in this project is Semantik
