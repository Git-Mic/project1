The idea behind this app is that whenever you go out to a venue, concert ,etc it is usually pretty expensive to dine there.In order to help the user decide what they want to eat we provide a service that when you pick a location you are given retaurants within driving distance of your venue.

The CSS framework that will be used in this project is Semantik

* Elevator pitch: We created this app for event users who always forget to eat or just like to eat before or after events. The idea behind this app is that people who like to go to events usually like to eat drink etc but they never know what is around them. Our page allows the user to look up an event specifically in certain venues to be expanded later.
* Our app we would lik eto eventually display a map with the venue in the middle and a certain radius around hte venue that can be shortened or lengthened based off if the user would like to walk or drive
we used ticketmaster to look up concerts specifically but wouldnt mind growing and using other APis which have events.
We used Ticketmaster and Google Places api
 The issues we had were geting the map to display instead of a list ,  and our sucess was making the images for the events work as a link that took the user to ticketmaster.
