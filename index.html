        <h2>What is Event Vitalz you ask!?</h2>
        <p>Event Vitalz is an application used in Florida that
            will allow you to look up events at the Orlando Kia Center Arena or the VyStar Veteran's Memorial Areana in Jacksonville
            and get further details on each event. Since food is either overpriced or not offered at all at these events, Event Vitalz
            has located all nearby resturants for you to enjoy either before or after!
